# About the game 🎮

Laneshifter is an endless runner game that can only be controlled using the mouse wheel. By scrolling up, the player jumps up, by scrolling down, the player jumps down. The entire game was realized with Unity using the universal render pipeline for authentic effects.

The game has a chunk based map generation. There are predefined chunks that can spawn randomly. As the player progresses, the pool of possible spawnable chunks increases. The game speed also increases. However, the player receives small checkpoints after different sections. Here the player stops and has the opportunity to buy upgrades with the money earned during the run.
